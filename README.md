# Breast Cancer Prediction

This repository implements a breast cancer  detection system using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Project Goal

The project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict breast cancer with some given features. This can assist medical professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Dependencies

* `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
* `pandas`: For data manipulation.
* `seaborn`: For advanced data visualization.
* `Flask` (Optional): To create a web app for interactive model deployment (see "Deployment" section below).

## Installation

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

   Highly recommended to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts. Here's an example using venv (I use Python 3.10):
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
      venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows

3. **Activate the virtual environment (commands above)**
4. **Install dependencies:**
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If you don't have a requirements.txt file, create one by listing all the dependencies mentioned above, one per line. 

## Data Acquisition
1. Download the breast cancer  dataset from Kaggle: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset).
2. Extract the downloaded archive.
